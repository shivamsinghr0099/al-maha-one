## ⚠️ Issues Found

### 1. **Building Manager Dashboard - Outdated Version**

**File:** `app/building-manager/dashboard/page.tsx`

**Problem:** The current file in the repository is an older, simpler version that lacks the comprehensive features we developed earlier. The Git sync overwrote our enhanced version.

**Missing Features:**
- Properties Management (list, add, edit, remove)
- Landlord Management with property connections
- Visit Management and Visit Purpose Management
- Report Priority and Report Category Management
- Community Wall Management
- Amenity Management and Amenity Booking Management
- Home Service Management and Service Product Management
- Service Provider Management
- Service Booking Management
- Comprehensive edit dialogs for all sections
- Scrollable horizontal tab navigation
- Settings tab with password reset

**Current State:** Basic dashboard with only 6 tabs (Overview, Services, Complaints, Tenants, Vendors, Emergency)

**Required State:** Comprehensive dashboard with 17 tabs and full CRUD operations for all management features

**Impact:** High - Building Manager cannot access critical management features

**Recommendation:** Restore the comprehensive version with all features from the API documentation

---

### 2. **Landlord Properties Page - Newly Created**

**File:** `app/building-manager/landlords/[id]/properties/page.tsx`

**Status:** ✓ Successfully created and properly structured

**Features:**
- Landlord profile section with contact information
- Portfolio overview stats (total properties, occupancy rate, revenue, vacant units)
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities
- Detailed property cards with images, location, units, occupancy rates
- Amenities display, maintenance status, inspection schedules
- Action buttons for viewing details, tenants, maintenance, and financial reports
- Responsive design with Maha One color scheme

**Impact:** None - This is a new feature addition
